Searching for Z
===============
This project is my first attemp to find Z bosons from dummy data

Set up the project
------------------

Before using the project you need to do:

- setupATLAS
- lsetup 'rcsetup Base,2.3.21'

and then you can compile with

- rc compile 

make your run folder
- mkdir runs

and run with grid, if your first time run do 1, and the second argument will mean grid run
- RunSearch runs/1 1

run without grid
- RunSearch runs/2 0
